# I Am Binod

A fun node cli inspired from the meme trend #binod.

![](iambinod.gif)

It adds "BINOD" comment by default to every file in a directory. Furthermore you can also specify some other comment to be added.

Installation:
```javascript
npm i -g iambinod
```

Usage:
```javascript
iambinod -p [Path to the file or directory] -c [comment to add]
```
-c and comment are optional. Path is a required parameter

Help:
```javascript
iambinod -h
```

This maybe(are) some bugs. Feel free to contribute.
